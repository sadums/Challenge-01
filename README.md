## Description

This project started out being unorganized and hard to navigate as well as having no internet accessibility. I solved this by adding semantic HTML elements and alt text, as well as keeping the CSS short and concise while retaining its functionality. I learned these skills as well as that having an accessible website will boost traffic on browsers.
